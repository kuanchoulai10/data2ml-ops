# Fraud Detection: from DataOps to MLOps

In real-world machine learning projects, managing the workflow from **data transformation to model deployment** is often fragmented, error-prone, and hard to scale.

This project demonstrates how to streamline and automate the entire lifecycle—**from feature engineering to hyperparameter tuning, model tracking, and deployment**—using modern open source tools and **running fully on Kubernetes**.

The use case for this project is **fraud detection**, a high-impact and time-sensitive problem where **real-time inference** is critical. It serves as a practical demo of how to operationalize machine learning pipelines that are **version-controlled**, **reproducible**, and **ready for production**.

It’s designed to be:

- [x] **Reproducible** – All data transformations, features, and models are versioned via dbt, Feast, and MLflow
- [x] **Scalable** – Built on Kubernetes, enabling distributed training and resource orchestration across services
- [x] **Modular** – Each stage is decoupled and replaceable, promoting clear responsibility and reuse
- [x] **Open Source** – Fully built on open source tools like dbt, Feast, Ray, Optuna, MLflow, and KServe
- [x] **Portable** – Easily adapted to other use cases beyond fraud detection

Whether you're a data engineer, ML practitioner, or platform builder, this project offers a clear, working example of how to **bridge DataOps and MLOps** on a scalable, production-ready foundation.
