# What, Why, When

## What is Ray?

Ray is an open-source framework designed to scale Python and AI workloads efficiently. It provides a unified API that allows developers to run Python applications seamlessly—from a laptop to a large distributed cluster.

Built with flexibility in mind, Ray includes a suite of libraries tailored for common machine learning tasks such as data loading and transformation (Ray Data), distributed training (Ray Train), hyperparameter tuning (Ray Tune), and scalable model serving (Ray Serve). These libraries are modular and interoperable, making it easier to build, scale, and manage end-to-end ML pipelines.

## Why Ray?

For data engineers, Ray offers Python-native distributed processing capabilities that make it easy to scale ETL and data workflows. With Ray Data, large-scale transformations and ingestion tasks can be executed efficiently without relying on heavier frameworks, improving overall pipeline performance.

For data analysts, Ray enables parallel computation on large datasets using familiar tools like Pandas. This accelerates data preparation and reduces wait times, making the analysis process faster and more productive—even when working with messy or high-volume data.

For data scientists, Ray's Train and Tune modules support scalable model training and hyperparameter optimization. It integrates seamlessly with popular ML frameworks, enabling rapid experimentation and efficient model tuning across different environments.

For machine learning engineers, Ray provides an end-to-end solution from training to deployment. With Ray Serve, models can be deployed and scaled with minimal overhead, while supporting flexible resource allocation and production-grade performance across varied use cases.

## When to Use Ray?

### Scaling Python Workloads Without Rewriting Code

When you need to scale Python applications—such as data preprocessing, simulations, or backtesting—Ray enables parallel execution across multiple cores or nodes with minimal code changes. Its Python-native API and dynamic task scheduling make it ideal for workloads that require fine-grained parallelism or involve dynamic task graphs[^2]. This allows developers to scale their applications efficiently without the complexity of traditional distributed systems.

### Accelerating Machine Learning Workflows

For machine learning tasks like distributed training and hyperparameter tuning, Ray's libraries—such as Ray Train and Ray Tune—provide scalable solutions that integrate seamlessly with popular ML frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. This enables faster experimentation and model optimization by leveraging distributed computing resources, reducing the time from development to deployment.

### Deploying Scalable and Responsive ML Services

When deploying machine learning models that require low-latency inference at scale, Ray Serve offers a flexible and production-ready serving layer. It supports dynamic model loading, autoscaling, and request batching, making it suitable for online prediction services and real-time ML applications. This ensures that ML services can handle varying loads efficiently while maintaining high performance.
